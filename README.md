Space Invaderz

This is my version of it. It is really similar to the original but with a few hard to notice changes.<br>
Shoot the inbound enemy ships and gain points.<br>

Controls:<br>
Left arrow = Move left<br>
Right arrow = Move right<br>
Spacebar = Shoot<br>
Exit key = Tab<br>
I also just noticed the main menu mentions moving up and down, but that is not a thing :D.<br>
