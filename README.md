Space Invaderz

This is my version of it. It is really similar to the original but with a few hard to notice changes.
Shoot the inbound enemy ships and gain points. I might add a leaderboard in 10 years if I am bored.

Controls:
Left arrow = Move left
Right arrow = Move right
Spacebar = Shoot
Exit key = Tab
I also just noticed the main menu mentions moving up and down, but that is not a thing :D.
